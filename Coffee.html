<h2>Coffee Info</h2>
<P>Coffee is a beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.Two species of coffee plants, Coffea arabica  canephora, supply almost all of the world’s consumption. Arabica is considered a milder and more flavourful and aromatic brew than Robusta, the main variety of C. canephora. The flatter and more elongated Arabica bean is more widespread than Robusta but more delicate and vulnerable to pests, requiring a cool subtropical climate; Arabica must grow at higher elevations (2,000–6,500 feet [600–2,000 metres]), it needs a lot of moisture, and it has fairly specific shade requirements. Latin America, eastern Africa, Asia, and Arabia are leading producers of Arabica coffee. The rounder, more convex Robusta bean, as its name suggests, is hardier and can grow at lower altitudes (from sea level to 2,000 feet). Robusta coffee is cheaper to produce, has twice the caffeine content of Arabica, and is typically the bean of choice for inexpensive commercial coffee brands. Western and Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and Brazil are major producers of Robusta coffee.</P>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Brewed Coffee</h3>
<p> To brew coffee, you can use different methods such as:
    <pre>
        -Cafetiere 
        -Filter
        -Coffee Maker
    </pre>
     Here are some general steps to follow:
    <pre>
    -Boil filtered water and let it cool slightly
    -Grind coffee beans to medium or medium-fine grind size, or use pre-ground coffee
    -Line the basket of your coffee maker or filter with a paper or reusable filter
    -Add the coffee grinds to the filter and pour the hot water over them
    -Wait for the coffee to brew, which may take a few minutes depending on the method and the amount of water
    -Enjoy your coffee
     </pre>

     <h3> Filtered Coffee</h3>
     <p>To make filtered coffee, you need to:
        <ul>
        <li>Grind your coffee beans into a medium grind (about the same size as castor sugar)</li>
        <li>Boil some water and pour it over the paper filter in your pour-over maker (such as V60 or Chemex) to preheat it and rinse it</li>
        <li>Measure the ground coffee and add it to the filter. The ratio of coffee to water can vary depending on your preference, but a common one is 60 grams of coffee per liter of water</li>
        <li>Pour a small amount of water over the ground coffee to wet it and let it bloom for about 30 seconds. This allows the coffee to release carbon dioxide and aroma</li>
        <li>Pour the rest of the water slowly and evenly over the coffee in a circular motion, avoiding the edges of the filter. The total brewing time should be around 3 to 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Enjoy your filtered coffee as it is, or add milk and sugar to your taste.</li> </ul> </p>

    <h3>Turkish Coffee</h3>
    <p>To make tradional turkish coffee you will need several ingredients:
        <pre>
            -Water
            -Turkish coffee
            -Sugar (by choice)
        </pre>
    2 scoops of turkish coffee are poured into the "cezve" (that is a metalic pod which is rensponsible for heating the water and the coffee together)also 300ml of water should be poured together with it.
    We should let the cezve rest under medium heat for several minutes until we noticed the turkish coffee starts to evaporate and making foam ready to spill across.Thats how we now that the coffee is ready now.
    We take it off the heat and we pour into a cup.We can add sugar by choice or also some additional sweeteners like stevia for instance.
